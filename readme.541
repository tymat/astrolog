                         **  VERSION 5.41  **


Astrolog: currently used in over 30 countries on six continents!

--
Astrolog 5.41 is a modified version of Astrolog 5.30. The older Placalc
ephemeris module has been replaced with the Swiss Ephemeris module.
The changes were made by Alois Treindl.

Astrolog is relatively unique in astrology software for the following reasons:
  (1) It's 100% freeware. :)
  (2) It runs on multiple platforms, such as DOS, Windows, Mac, and Unix.
  (3) The full source code is available.
  (4) Features are accessible from the command line and from shell scripts.
  (5) It offers many features not found in most other programs.

"The Best Freeware/Shareware Program of 1995 is Astrolog for Windows"
- American Astrology, March 1996

"One exceptionally good freeware program is available to astrologers -
good enough to be worthy of review with the main commercial programs.
This is Astrolog..." - The Mountain Astrologer, November 1995

"For a free program to have such a superb ephemeris with an 8000-year
range is incredible." - American Astrology, November 1994

Astrolog system requirements:

For PC's, 640K of RAM and a reasonably recent version of DOS. A math
co-processor chip is recommended for best performance but not
required. Astrolog can take advantage of Ansi text, CGA, EGA, VGA,
and SVGA graphics but they are not required. The program will run on
8088 AT and XT systems and higher x86 processors. The DOS version of
Astrolog may be run from MS Windows in a DOS box.

For compiling the source code for PC's, the Microsoft C compiler
version C6 or later, or Borland Turbo C/C++ compiler version 3.0 or
later. Other compilers should work although one will probably have to
compile out the screen graphics sections.

For the Windows version, at least 2M of RAM and Windows 3.1 or later.
Astrolog for Windows will run under Windows for Workgroups, Windows
'95, and Windows NT. For compiling the Windows version, Microsoft
Visual C version 1.5 or later is recommended, although most any
Windows compiler should work provided it can compile resource files.

For Unix systems, some C compiler is required since ready to run
executables aren't available. Astrolog can take advantage of X11
Windows but they are not required.

Astrolog will compile and work on VMS systems, even with X Windows,
but this isn't officially tested. A .COM makefile script is included.

On the Macintosh Astrolog will compile and run with every feature
including some interactive graphics, using for example the Symantec
C/C++ 7.0 compiler for the Mac. It will run on any reasonably recent
68K Mac with 750K free, and will run on PowerMac's in emulation mode.

A few third party ports of Astrolog are publicly available. This
includes a port of Astrolog version 4.00 to OS/2 Presentation Manager
by David Serls, a port of Astrolog 2.25 to the Macintosh but with
interactive graphics by Pascal Lamboley, and a port to the Amiga by
Tobias Ferber.

Where to get Astrolog:

Astrolog's homepage at http://www.magitech.com/~cruiser1/astrolog.htm
which allows downloads using a Web interface of all the Astrolog
files at the Magitech FTP site below. This site also offers
information on the program, current bug lists, screen shots, and
links to related sites.

The anonymous FTP site ftp.magitech.com (or magitech.tcastle.is.net),
maintained by J.H. Trott. The directory /pub/astrology/astrolog
contains all executables, documentation, and source code, for DOS,
Windows, Unix, and the Mac. All ephemeris files are available in the
subdirectory /pub/astrology/astrolog/ephem.

The anonymous FTP site ftp.coast.net (and its mirrors such as
oak.oakland.edu). These are SimTel sites where the PC Astrolog files
may be found in /SimTel/msdos/entertn in the file ast54dos.zip, and
in /SimTel/win3/entertn in the files ast54win.zip and ast54src.zip.

The BBS "Astro Net-1" at US phone number 414-481-9976, maintained by
Carl Baewer. This is for PC's only, but has all DOS and Windows
executables, source, documentation, and ephemeris files. They do want
one to register first, but that and downloads are free minus any long
distance charges.

Several past versions of Astrolog have been posted to the Usenet
newsgroup comp.sources.misc and hence are available at many other FTP
sites archiving this group. Utilities such as archie can locate these
sites, such as ftp.uu.net. The latest Astrolog release for which this
was done is 4.10, in volume 32. (Older versions are in volumes 37,
30, and 28.) Note that those releases are only in Unix shell archive
format and have no binary files in them.

Right after a new release, the files for Astrolog may sometimes be
found on the Usenet newsgroup alt.astrology, while the Unix source
can sometimes be found on comp.sources.misc if the version in
question was submitted there, until the articles expire.

Note that the following anonymous FTP sites used to contain astrology
files but don't anymore: hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au, maintained by
Michael Bulmer, and ftp.u.washington.edu.
