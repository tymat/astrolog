Power calculations in this versions are generally the same as those in the 
original Astrolog. The changes are explained in this text.  Additions are 
marked *** . Most coefficients are slightly different from the original.

Every object and house are given their initial power in the astrolog.dat file.

for objects  rObjInf[i]
for objects ruling in sign rObjInf[rules], the same value for all objects,
for objects exalted in sign rObjInf[exalt], the same value for all objects.
for houses rHouseInf[i]
for objects ruling in house rHouseInf[rules], the same value for all objects.
for objects exalt in house rHouseInf[exalt], the same for all all objects.


POWERS OF OBJECTS:

1) _First_, for each object, find its power based on its placement alone
(positional power).  This is also used in aspect power calculations (instead
of fixed values from original Astrolog).

ppower1[i] += rObjInf[i];            /* Influence of planet itself. */
ppower1[i] += rHouseInf[inhouse[i]]; /* Influence of house it's in. */

Planets ruling, exalted, etc. in sign/house gain additions.  Additions from
houses are divided into two parts - by natural rulership and situational
rulership. 

In a sign:
           += rObjInf[rules]     /* rules */
           += rObjInf[exalt]     /* exalted */
           -= rObjInf[i]/3.0     /* falls */                   ***
           -= rObjInf[i]/4.0     /* debilitated */             ***

In house (natural):
           += rHouseInf[rules]/2.0 /* rules */
           += rHouseInf[exalt]/2.0 /* exalt */
           -= rObjInf[i]/6.0       /* falls */                 ***
           -= rObjInf[i]/8.0       /* debilitated */           ***

In house (situative):
           += rHouseInf[rules]/2.0 /* rules */                 ***
           += rHouseInf[exalt]/2.0 /* exalt */                 ***
           -= rObjInf[i]/6.0       /* falls */                 ***
           -= rObjInf[i]/8.0       /* debilitated */           ***

The ruler [j] of a sign, where a planet [i] is found, gains an addition.
For ruling planets we take into account ruling level (see influence graphics
output). Planets in reception have the highest level (same as planets in their
own signs), so they automatically have more power.

Main (ruling) planets:

ppower1[j] += rObjInf[i]/(5.0*sqrt(Level[j]);  /* look for level */   ***

Other objects (as rulers they have low initial power, so these additions are
small too):

ppower1[j] += rObjInf[i]/5.0;


Analogous additions are given to rulers of signs, where an object is. But here
additions are divided - 1/2 to the natural ruler, and 1/2 to the situational 
ruler.

Natural Ruler:

Main planets:

ppower1[j] += rObjInf[i]/(10.0*sqrt(Level[j])   /* look for level */  ***

Other objects:

ppower1[j] += rObjInf[i]/10.0;                                    ***


Exactly the same for Situational Ruler:

Main planets:

ppower1[j] += rObjInf[i]/(10.0*sqrt(Level[j])  /* look for level */   ***

Other objects:

ppower1[j] += rObjInf[i]/10.0;                                    ***


House cusps give an addition to sign rulers (cusps here are objects!)

Main planets:         += rHouseInf[i]/2.0

Now, when all position powers are calculated, we give an addition to house
cusps (as objects), if there is something in that house.

House cusps:          += ppower1[i]/10.0                          ***


3) _Second_, for each object, find its power based on aspects it makes.
This version starts with the power of aspects rAspInf[k]; also orbs for
aspects, and objects can have orb additions or limitations.

So, if an object [j] has an aspect [k] with object [i], to [j] is given 
additional aspect power:

power2[j] += rAspInf[k]*(sqrt)(power1[i]*power1[j])*0.5*         ***
          (1.0-RAbs((real)l)/60.0/GetOrb(i,j,k));

That means if an aspect is exact its power is maximal, and decreases linearly
to zero, when the real orb exceeds the given orb for the current aspect. 
Differences with original Astrolog:
1. Instead of planet power fixed in rObjInf[i], position powers are used, 
   as calculated previously.  So more powerful planets (by position) have more
   powerful aspects.
2. Instead of arithmatic mean--(power[i]+power[j])/2.0, the geometrical mean--
   sqrt(power[i]*power[j]) is used.  This is because, if power1[i] or power1[j]
   is zero, in the second case the power of an aspect also is zero.  In the
   first case (original Astrolog) this isn't so.
3. In the case of "Smart Cusps" (see helpfile.540), both opposite unrestricted
   cusps have additions (but planets in this case gain an addition only from
   one cusp).

3) _Third_, added analogous calculations for parallel-contraparallel aspects,
   where orbs are temporariliy decreased 6 times (to about 1 deg) and powers
   of aspects 4 times. These are default values and both can be independently
   set in the astrolog.dat file (i.e. one can for example decrease orbs 6
   times, without changing a parallel's power).

Changes 1. and 2. are used also in aspect power calculations with switch -a (-a0).

Adding of position and aspect parts gives the TOTAL POWER of an object.


POWERS OF SIGNS:

Powers of signs are determined by power of ruler and powers of objects in that
sign:

power_of_sign[i] += power[rules(i)];    /* Power of ruler of sign */   ***

powers of planets, placed in sign:

power_of_sign[i] += power[j];        /* Powers of real objects in sign */

or power of other objects in sign:

power_of_sign[i] += power[j]/3.0;   /* Powers of other objects in sign */


POWERS OF HOUSES:

In this version analogous calculations of powers of houses (both
natural and situational) are made.  They are determined by the initial power of
house, power of cusp, powers of both situational and natural rulers and 
powers of different objects in house.

power_of_house[i] = rHouseInf[i];          /* Internal power of house  */ 
power_of_house[i] += power[cusp[i]];       /* Power of house cusp      */   ***
power_of_house[i] += power[rules(i)]/2.0;  /* Natural ruler of house   */   ***
power_of_house[i] += power[rules(i)]/2.0;  /* Situative ruler of house */   ***

powers of planets, placed in sign:

power_of_sign[i] += power[j];        /* Powers of real objects in sign */

or power of other objects in sign:

power_of_sign[i] += power[j]/3.0;   /* Powers of other objects in sign */


Note that in the astrolog.dat file there are two sets of powers connected with
houses. Powers, which are set with the switch

-Yj 21 32 <value1> <value2> ....

are initial powers of house cusps as objects (so there are initial powers for
Asc, Des, IC, MC, etc.), visible on the wheel.

The second set is determined with the switch

-YjC 1 12 <value1> <value2> ....

These powers are used in planetary power calculations (as an addition to a
planet's power if the planet is placed in a respective house).  Also these are
the initial powers of the houses, as used above.  So these are different powers
and they influence different things in a chart.


ADDITIONAL CALCULATIONS IN INFLUENCE CHARTS:

The last table lists components of aspect powers which planets (and unrestricted
cusps) have.
They are:
 
  1. Sum of harmonic aspects. 
  2. Sum of tension aspects 
  3. Harmonic/tension sum, where harmonic aspect powers have positive values 
     and tension aspects powers negative ones.  A planet with both tension
     and harmonic aspects can be actually end up in sum neutral (but have a big 
     influence by aspect).
  4. Sum of conjunctions which planets make.
  5. Total sum of aspects - more aspected planets have a bigger sum, even if they
     are neutral by tension/harmony.
